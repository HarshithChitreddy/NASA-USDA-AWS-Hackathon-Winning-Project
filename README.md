# 🚀 Rover Rescue Optimization – Hackathon Winning Project

This project was developed as part of the 2025 CSU AI/ML Hackathon, co-hosted by **USDA**, **NASA**, and **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

Our team — **Quinn Peterson, Brendan Geraci, Joshua Weisner**, and myself — built a solution titled **Rover Rescue Optimization**, which was awarded **Best Performing Rover Path Transversal Model**.

### 🛰 Project Summary

Our solution used:
- **Satellite imagery (NAIP)**
- **Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data**
- A custom-implemented **Bidirectional A\* Search Algorithm**

The model successfully reduced rover pathfinding **computation time by approximately 70%**, allowing a virtual rover to navigate complex terrain and reach a target efficiently.

### 🏆 Achievements

- 🥇 Recognized as **Best Performing Model** by judges from NASA, USDA, and AWS
- 🏅 Received **Letters of Recommendation** from NASA and USDA highlighting:
  - Technical excellence
  - Creativity
  - Collaboration and communication
  - Real-world application of AI/ML in public sector challenges

### 🙏 Acknowledgements

Special thanks to **Fredy Diaz**, **Anna Steers-Smith**, **Martin Garcia, Jr., MBA**, and the **DevNet.CSU team** for mentoring and organizing this outstanding event.
